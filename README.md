UBER Data Insights: Bengaluru Ride Analysis Dashboard
An interactive data visualization and analytics project that explores ride patterns, cancellations, customer satisfaction, and revenue trends from Uber’s Bengaluru dataset—highlighting operational efficiency and key business insights through SQL and Power BI.

📝 2. Short Description / Purpose

The UBER Data Insights Dashboard is a comprehensive and dynamic Power BI report built to analyze a month’s worth of simulated Uber ride data (1,00,000+ records) for Bengaluru city. It enables users to visualize booking trends, cancellation behaviors, ride distances, and customer-driver performance metrics.
This project is designed for data analysts, business strategists, and transportation planners seeking to optimize operations, understand customer patterns, and identify revenue opportunities within the ride-sharing ecosystem.

🧰 3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

• 🗃️ SQL (MySQL) – Used for querying and analyzing booking, cancellation, and ride performance data.
• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Primary visualization tool used to create dynamic and interactive dashboards.
• ⚙️ Power Query – For data transformation, cleaning, and preprocessing of the raw dataset before visualization.
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Applied for calculated metrics, key performance indicators (KPIs), and dynamic filtering.
• 🧩 Data Modeling – Established relationships between tables (bookings, customers, drivers, and payments) to enable accurate cross-analysis.
• 💾 Excel / CSV Data Source – Generated synthetic data for 1 month of rides with over 1 lakh records.
• 📁 File Formats – .sql for queries, .pbix for dashboard, .csv for dataset, .pdf for documentation.
